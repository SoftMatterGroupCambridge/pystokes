Simulation of colloid in harmonic traps
---

Examples include

* Active colloids in a harmonic trap
* Active colloids in two-dimensional lattices of harmonic traps
* Passive colloids in harmonic traps


You will need to install Odespy to run these simulations. Alternatively, edit the code to write your favourite integrator.
