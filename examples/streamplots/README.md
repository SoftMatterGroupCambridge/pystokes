## Flow evaluation
--

This folder contains codes to plot flow streamlines in different geometries of stokes flow. Refer to the notebook folder for Jupyter notebooks for the same.

It should be noted that fluid velocity at any given set of grid points in 3D can be evaluated directly using the ``Flow`` class of each geometry. The resulting data can, then, be used in any visualization software to obtain the flow fields.
